In the future, our cities will be more polluted and crowded. There will  be more cars in our cities so there will be more pollution. And there  will be fewer trees and less water, so environmen will be worse. So we  should play a part in saving the earth. In 30 years, there will be more  robots and computers. People won't work long hours, because computers  and robots will help them a lot. The student won't go to school, they  will study on computers at home. So, people will have more free time and  they will be able to enjoy the things they love-sports for example I  think that life in the future won't be the same as it is today
